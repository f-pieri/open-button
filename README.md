# Open Button

## What is this?
The Open Button is an open-source contribution to Google‚Äôs Chromium project. It adds a button to chrome://history that lets users reopen multiple closed tabs with a single click.

## Usage
To begin with, [install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode). This is the way Synthwave '84 is intended to be used day-to-day. If you want to enable the gratuitous 80s glow, it needs a little extra work to get it going. 

This feature is currently available across the following Chrome channels:

  &emspCanary ‚Äì version 140.0.7339.2 (released August 5, 2025)

  Dev ‚Äì version 140.0.7327.6 (released July 31, 2025)

  Beta ‚Äì version 140.0.7339.16 (released August 13, 2025)

  Stable ‚Äì version [insert version] (released [insert date])

For usage within Chromium, check out the official [Chromium Documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/README.md).

## Compatibility
This theme is still **very much a work in progress**. I primarily develop in HTML & CSS, JS, React and Elixir so, whilst those language sets should look pretty good, there will likely be issues for other languages. I'll work on adding more support as I go. If you find anything glaringly wrong, raise an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

## Contributing
I'm really happy to consider any contributions to this theme. Before you make any changes, [please read the contribution guide](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thanks
Lastly, I couldn't have made this if it weren't for the fantastic work of [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Her [tutorial on theming for CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a huge help in developing this üôè

Similarly, I'd like to thanks [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for his [cool Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode). His readme helped me figure out how to package this hot mess for public use üëç

If this theme is too much, then I recommend [Horizon](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), or [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/) for a similar, yet more understated, retro vibe. They're both beautiful.
