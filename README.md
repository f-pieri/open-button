## What is this?
I was a kid in the 80s but for most of my teenage life I strongly disliked nearly everything about the 80s aesthetic of my childhood. It was like, _so lame_. With the hindsight of recent years though, I've realised that it was actually pretty sweet and I wanted to celebrate it a little. 

Much the same way, in the modern web-development world of shaders, React and WebGL, I feel like it's easy to forget that the basics are actually pretty damn good. To that end, this theme goes back to basics - No Shader magic. No cloud-streamed WebGL render-farms. Just plain CSS :)

## Installation
To begin with, [install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode). This is the way Synthwave '84 is intended to be used day-to-day. If you want to enable the gratuitous 80s glow, it needs a little extra work to get it going. 

## Screenshots


#### To customise the glow brightness
In your `settings.json` add the key:
```
"synthwave84.brightness": 0.45
```
The value should be a _float value_ from 0 to 1, where 0.0 is fully transparent. The default brightness is 0.45. To avoid eye strain, avoid using higher brightness values for extended periods of time. 

To see the changes, you need to rerun the activation function. Open your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "__Enable Neon Dreams__".

Note: Changing the brightness currently only affects the opacity of the glow, the text will remain white (that may change in future updates). If you want to disable the glow effect but retain the chrome updates, see below.

#### To enable editor chrome updates, but disable glow
In your `settings.json` add the key:
```
"synthwave84.disableGlow": true
```
To see the changes, you need to rerun the activation function. Open your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "__Enable Neon Dreams__".

### To remove corruption warning and [unsupported] from title-bar
Because enabling the glow modifies core files, VS code will interpret this as the core being 'corrupted' and you may see an error message on restarting your editor. You can safely dismiss this message, or remove it entirely with the [Fix VSCode Checksums](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums 'Fix VSCode Checksums') extension.

Upon installation of 'Fix VSCode Checksums', open the command palette and execute `Fix Checksums: Apply`. You will need to completely restart VSCode after execution, reopening without fully exiting might not be enough.

## Updates
Every time you update VS code, you will need to repeat this step to re-enable the glow.

## Disabling the glow and uninstallation
The glow effect started as a joke and was never intended for long-term coding sessions. If you want to turn it off, you can disable it at any time by opening your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "__Disable Neon Dreams__".

### Font
I haven't included a font in this release as I know that it's a very personal preference. The font I use (that is seen in the image above) is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which I recommend if you're a fan of ligatures.

## Compatibility
This theme is still **very much a work in progress**. I primarily develop in HTML & CSS, JS, React and Elixir so, whilst those language sets should look pretty good, there will likely be issues for other languages. I'll work on adding more support as I go. If you find anything glaringly wrong, raise an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

## Contributing
I'm really happy to consider any contributions to this theme. Before you make any changes, [please read the contribution guide](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thanks
Lastly, I couldn't have made this if it weren't for the fantastic work of [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Her [tutorial on theming for CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a huge help in developing this üôè

Similarly, I'd like to thanks [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for his [cool Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode). His readme helped me figure out how to package this hot mess for public use üëç

If this theme is too much, then I recommend [Horizon](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), or [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/) for a similar, yet more understated, retro vibe. They're both beautiful.
