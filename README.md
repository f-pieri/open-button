## What is this?
I was a kid in the 80s but for most of my teenage life I strongly disliked nearly everything about the 80s aesthetic of my childhood. It was like, _so lame_. With the hindsight of recent years though, I've realised that it was actually pretty sweet and I wanted to celebrate it a little. 

Much the same way, in the modern web-development world of shaders, React and WebGL, I feel like it's easy to forget that the basics are actually pretty damn good. To that end, this theme goes back to basics - No Shader magic. No cloud-streamed WebGL render-farms. Just plain CSS :)

## usage
To begin with, [install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode). This is the way Synthwave '84 is intended to be used day-to-day. If you want to enable the gratuitous 80s glow, it needs a little extra work to get it going.

Upon installation of 'Fix VSCode Checksums', open the command palette and execute `Fix Checksums: Apply`. You will need to completely restart VSCode after execution, reopening without fully exiting might not be enough.

## Updates
Every time you update VS code, you will need to repeat this step to re-enable the glow.

## Disabling the glow and uninstallation
The glow effect started as a joke and was never intended for long-term coding sessions. If you want to turn it off, you can disable it at any time by opening your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "__Disable Neon Dreams__".

### Font
I haven't included a font in this release as I know that it's a very personal preference. The font I use (that is seen in the image above) is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which I recommend if you're a fan of ligatures.

## Compatibility
This theme is still **very much a work in progress**. I primarily develop in HTML & CSS, JS, React and Elixir so, whilst those language sets should look pretty good, there will likely be issues for other languages. I'll work on adding more support as I go. If you find anything glaringly wrong, raise an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

## Contributing
I'm really happy to consider any contributions to this theme. Before you make any changes, [please read the contribution guide](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thanks
Lastly, I couldn't have made this if it weren't for the fantastic work of [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Her [tutorial on theming for CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a huge help in developing this üôè

Similarly, I'd like to thanks [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for his [cool Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode). His readme helped me figure out how to package this hot mess for public use üëç

If this theme is too much, then I recommend [Horizon](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), or [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/) for a similar, yet more understated, retro vibe. They're both beautiful.
